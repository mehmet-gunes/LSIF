 ## IoT Traffic Flow Identification using Locality Sensitive Hashes


**Abstract** Systems get smarter with computing capabilities,
especially in the form of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. IoT
devices are often resource-limited as they are optimized for a
certain task. Hence, they are prone to be compromised and have
become a target of malicious activities. Since IoT devices lack
computing power for security software, network administrators
need to isolate such devices and limit traffic to the device based on
their communication needs. To this end, network administrators
need to identify IoT devices when they join a network and
detect anomalous traffic when they are compromised. In this
paper, we introduce a novel approach to identify the IoT device
based on the Nilsimsa hash of its traffic flow. Different from
previous studies, the proposed approach does not require feature
extraction from the data. In our evaluations, our approach has
an average precision and recall of 93% and 90%, respectively.
